# Introduction

The rapidity of the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is one of the most notable features of this disease.  Much scientific and journalistic investigation into epidimeological aspects of the coronavirus have focused on *case fatality rates* (CFRs) and other demographic variables that may contribute to increased morbidity.  For instance, it has been argued based on data deriving from China and more recently the CDC, that CFRs for those under 40 are relatively low. 

In contrast, less attention has been given to the *case detection rate* (CDR) by age, except in cases where the asymptomatic nature of transmission has been noted, especially in younger age groups. This analysis aggregates available data from US states to identify which age groups are potentially leaders in CDRs, and the extent to which this is variable by state or a broader consequence of the disease.  All analyses are for visualization purposes -- no inferential statistics have been employed due to the inherent biases emanating from under-testing of the US population.

First, thanks are given to the site www.covidtracking.com, which has provided the links to various state pages with demographic data.  Second, this is an ongoing "document" that is updated every day.  The paragraph below describes the represented date range of data and states represented.  Unfortunately, due to the vagaries of state reporting, most states do not provide sufficient data to conduct these analyses.  For comments, concerns, or access to higher resolution data, please contact me at alanfarahani@gmail.com.

The assembled data extend from `r min(covid_age_raw$date)` to `r max(recent_covid_data$date)`, and comprise `r length(unique(recent_covid_data$state))` unique states (the states represented are `r sort(unique(recent_covid_data$state))`) for a total of `r sum(unique(recent_covid_data$total))` confirmed cases.

# Methods and Materials

Data are acquired from state sources where age-demographic material is published (e.g. https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx).  In most cases, states provide either the raw case count or a proportion of cases followed by an absolute number of confirmed cases.

Screenshots of all of the state pages are taken, and the data are hand-recorded into an excel spreadsheet that contains untransformed data.  In one case (the state of Connecticut), absolute numeric data apart from the total number of confirmed cases are not provided.  Nevertheless a graph is -- therefore counts for each age range were estimated visually and the sum of these counts was made to match the published confirmed cases.  Therefore it is possible there is some error (~ +/-10) associated with the estimates for this state.

```{r, fig.cap = "Representative example of data supplied by the state of Nevada regarding distribution of confirmed cases across age ranges.  Accessed on 26-03-2020."}
knitr::include_graphics("./0326/Screenshot_2020-03-26 Power BI Report.png")
```

# Major Trends

Without transformation of the age-ranges, the percent of confirmed cases by ages as of `r max(unique(recent_covid_data$date))` can be seen in the figure below. 

```{r state-dist, fig.width=10, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases by age-range given by state authorities."}
#generate a common theme
covid_bar_theme <- list(
    theme_bw(base_size = 15),
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = "none"),
    scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "red"),
    scale_color_continuous(low = "white", high = "red"),
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))
)

recent_covid_data %>%
    mutate(age_range = paste(lower_age, upper_age, sep = "-")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(fct_rev(age_range), prop)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = prop), colour = "black") +
    facet_wrap(~state, scales = "free_y") + coord_flip() +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("\n Percent (%) of Cases") +
    covid_bar_theme

```

It can be observed that contrary to widespread assumptions, positive carriers of the novel coronavirus (at least those who were symptomatic or suspicious enough of their condition to seek testing), can range uniformly across age groups.  Inter-state differences must be accounted for either by a) patterns of community spread of the virus specific to the social dynamics of those states and/or b) patterns of testing based on the ability of state officials (and representatives) to respond.

```{r new-range-data-prep}
# not being used now but kept for future interest
# generate new ranges
gen_age_label <- function(state_name){
  recent_covid_data %>% filter(state == state_name) %>%
  mutate(age_range = paste(lower_age, upper_age, sep = "-")) %>% pull(age_range)
}

nv_label <- nv_label <- gen_age_label("Nevada")


state_grp1 <- c("Colorado", "Connecticut", "Massachussets", "Nevada", "Oregon")
#state_grp2 <- c("California", "Georgia")

graph_grp1 <- recent_covid_data %>%
    filter(state %in% state_grp1) %>%
    mutate(age_range = cut(lower_age, breaks = c(-1,seq(from = 9, to = 69, by = 10), 100), labels = nv_label)) %>%
    group_by(age_range) %>%
    summarise(cases = sum(cases), totals = sum(unique(total)), state = "Group 1")

# graph_grp2 <- recent_covid_data %>%
#     filter(state %in% state_grp2) %>%
#     mutate(age_range = cut(lower_age, breaks = c(-1, 17, 49, 64, 100), labels = cal_label)) %>%
#     group_by(age_range) %>%
#     summarise(cases = sum(cases), totals = sum(unique(total)), state = "Group 2")
  
graph_else <- recent_covid_data %>%
  filter(!(state %in% c(state_grp1))) %>%
  mutate(age_range = paste(lower_age, upper_age, sep = "-")) %>%
    group_by(state, age_range) %>%
    summarise(cases = sum(cases), totals = sum(unique(total)))

all_new_state_graphs <- bind_rows(graph_grp1, graph_else)

rm(graph_grp1, graph_else)
    
```

```{r state-dist-raw, fig.width=10, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Total Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by age-range given by state authorities."}
recent_covid_data %>%
    mutate(age_range = paste(lower_age, upper_age, sep = "-")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(fct_rev(age_range), cases)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = prop), colour = "black") +
    facet_wrap(~state, scales = "free_y") + coord_flip() +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("\n Absolute Count of Cases") +
    covid_bar_theme +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


The absolute change in the age-demographic profile of recent confirmed COVID-19 cases can be seen in the figure below.  The black points represent the previous absolute number of cases (on log scale), while the open colored points represents the new number of cases, and the size and color of the circle represent the percent increases in cases (the darker red, the larger the percentage increase). It is important to note that some states are actively in the process of changing their age-reporting ranges, and therefore some states (such as Georgia and Washington) may not have cumulative case data that concords with previously published data.

```{r covid-case-change, fig.cap = "Absolute change in confirmed coronavirus cases where the black points represent all previously aggregated data.  The colors and size of the rightmost points indicate the intensity of the proportional change.", fig.height=8, fig.width=9}

covid_case_change <- previous_covid_data %>%
    inner_join(recent_covid_data %>%
                 select(state, lower_age, upper_age, cases) %>%
                 rename(new_cases = cases)) %>%
    mutate(prop_change = ((new_cases - cases)/cases) *100)

covid_case_change %>%
    mutate(age_range = paste(lower_age, upper_age, sep = "-")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(fct_rev(age_range), new_cases)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = prop_change, colour = prop_change)) +
    geom_point(aes(y = cases))+
    geom_line(aes(group = 1))+
    geom_segment(aes(x = age_range, xend =age_range, y = cases, yend = new_cases ), linetype = "dashed")+
facet_wrap(~state, scales = "free_y") +
    coord_flip() +
    xlab("") +
    ylab(sprintf("\n Absolute change (log-10 scaled) in confirmed coronavirus cases as of %s.",  max(recent_covid_data$date))) +
    covid_bar_theme +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Finally, the graph below illustrates the change through time in the total case count per age group in five states that contain the same age-range demarcation scheme.  

```{r covid-over-time, fig.cap = "Absolute change in confirmed coronavirus cases on a log scale over time.  The colors of the lines indicate the age ranges.  A gap in the line indicates no data recorded for that dya..", fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
covid_age_raw %>%
    filter(state %in% state_grp1) %>%
    mutate(age_range = cut(lower_age, breaks = c(-1,seq(from = 9, to = 69, by = 10), 100), labels = nv_label)) %>%
    group_by(state, date, age_range) %>%
    summarise(cases = sum(cases), totals = sum(unique(total))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, cases)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = age_range, colour = age_range), size = 1) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
          legend.position = "top") +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") +
    facet_wrap(~state) +
    xlab("") + 
    ylab("Total Number of Cases (on log scale) \n") +
    labs(colour = "Age Range")
```


# Recommendations
In order to effectively combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, data on community transmission is needed.  In particular, understanding how and why the virus spreads among certain age demographics rather than others can help official planners respond in advance to possible transmission scenarios.  Furthermore, these data are also essential in messaging to all populations, especially those with maximal visibility in flouting physical distancing recommendations, that transmission of the virus is more demographically widespread than perhaps assumed.
